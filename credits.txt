This mod is a compilation of work from many, many different people.
We use GSGVickyMod 2.0a as base, which uses GSGVickyMod 1.06 as a base, which uses NNM as a base.

Credits from GSGVickymod 1.06
FinnBro (amongst many aliases that the creator uses) created this minimod for the GSG community.
The only true tripcode you will ever see FinnBro use is FinnBro!!UIw63MjXv78.
If you see a different tripcode without a major announcement and transition period, it is an impostor.
If he ever uses this trip regularly and outside of release posts, then put him out of his misery for the good of the world. 
Hisuibro is currently updating minimod now, I'll do my best!
I wont use a tripcode ever if I'm lucky, you can find me posting Hisui images or space marine cups, although other people like to post the space marine cups
Also, thank you anons, you guys provide ideas, localization and mountains of research help. Love you guys.
Thank you to Rylock and his fine people for making NNM so I can bust my ass making my mod compatible with it. I hope they don't get mad.
Full NNM credits are found here: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?592320-New-Nations-Mod-(For-AHD)
A big thank you to Napoops (the guy making the Napoleon's Legacy mod for /gsg/) for the Lucky Nations decisions as well as a few other bits of errata.

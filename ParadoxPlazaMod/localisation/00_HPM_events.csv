Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board.

Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. These rights have now been rescinded and the condition of virtual slavery that the serfs lived turned into real slavery.

However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples. The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centered in, Palermo.

The "pivotal idea" of al-Wahhab's teaching was that people who called themselves Muslims but who participated in such innovations were not just misguided or committing a sin, but were "outside the pale of Islam altogether", as were Muslims who disagreed with his definition. Muhammad ibn Saud, invited al-Wahhab to join him and in 1744 a pact was made between the two. Ibn Saud would protect and propagate the doctrines of the Wahhabi mission, while Wahhab "would support the ruler, supplying him with 'glory and power'".

Using his Concession between Rhodes' British South Africa Company and Lobengula, he then sought and obtained a charter from the British government allowing him to act.

EVTDESC441266;In 1820, the American Colonization Society (ACS) began sending African American volunteers to the Pepper Coast to establish a colony for freed African Americans. The ACS, a private organization supported by prominent American politicians such as Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, and James Monroe, believed repatriation was preferable to emancipation of slaves, and they founded a colony on what is known as Liberia. The colony of Liberia was poor and economically dependent on the ACS, resulting that by the 1840s, the ACS was effectively bankrupt: Liberia had become a financial burden for it.

EVTDESC98647;The area known as the Bahr el Ghazal in South Sudan had long been the source of the goods that Darfur would trade to Egypt and North Africa, especially slaves and ivory. The natives of Bahr el Ghazal paid tribute to Darfur, and these were the chief articles of merchandise sold by the Darfurians to the Egyptian traders along the road to Asyut. Al-Zubayr redirected this flow of goods to Khartoum and the Nile with his conquest of South Sudan.

EVTDESC98646;The lack of formal authority in South Sudan, which was claimed by Egypt, was filled in the 1850s by a set of powerful merchant princes. In the east Muhammad Ahmad al-Aqqad controlled much land, but the most powerful was Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur who came to control the Bahr el Ghazal and other parts of South Sudan. Al-Zubayr was a merchant from Khartoum, who hired his own private army and marched south. He set up a network of trading forts known as zaribas through the region, and from these forts controlled local trade. To manage the trade al-Zubayr needed labour, and thus also began to capture a significant number of slaves.

We're well aware that this is just an excuse for these men to gain more influence in $COUNTRY$-- but there could be benefits for us as well, namely using the opportunity to gain insight into their methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT13185OPTA;Attend the function.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT13185OPTB;Refuse. We don't need their methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME13186;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13186;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepreneurs recently spent time plying $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials with liquor and favors at a formal affair in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s legation quarter. The result is promising-- a number of new business ventures and trade deals, giving $COUNTRY$ greater sway over $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ affairs. All these men require is our government's support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13220;Several of the Great Powers have in the past few years sought to establish formalized and permanent embassies in $COUNTRYNAME$, but up until now we've turned down their proposals. However, an idea has been floating around the capital that we should perhaps allow them to set up these embassies after all, provided they are all kept in one place where we can exact some amount of control over them. Perhaps a Legation Quarter in $CAPITAL$ could be just the thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT13186OPTA;We'll gladly support this initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT13186OPTB;They have our permission to continue, but we can offer no support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT13186OPTC;This is not in our best interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME13202;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13202;Our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have worsened to the point that members of their government have begun a campaign to reduce or even eliminate $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence. Some of our diplomats have fled, and now we are faced with the unpleasant prospect of either enforcing our interests or suffering embarrassment at our inability to manage a former ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13240_NEW;The oil lamp flickered, casting an orange, sooty glow across the moist brown of the cargo hold. The average ship docking in $COUNTRY$ carried very little to raise an eyebrow, but years of being fooled and fooled again by foreign merchants, trying to dodge some excise or other, had left him with a sixth sense for when things were out of order. A rat scurrying between some crates tipped him off. A sweet, pungent scent too familiar not to be alluring. Opium. A cargo hold full of opium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37710;Carlism Prevails;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37710;A new line of the Bourbon family has been established on the Spanish throne, descending from the Infante Carlos. To many traditionalists, this signals a rebirth of the true Spanish Empire. Others are not so optimistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT37710OPTA;Long live the true King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME37711;The First Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37711;The death of King Ferdinand in 1833 and the ascension of young Isabela (only three years old at the time) to the throne of Spain sparked a revolt by supporters of the King's brother, the Infante Carlos. He intends to depose Isabela and establish a separate branch of the Bourbon family, as well as restore the Spanish Empire to its traditional glory -- something liberals say simply cannot be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37713;Return of the Carlists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37713;We thought the supporters of the Infante Carlos and his descendants had been completely routed, yet once again there are reports of a cell having been established in one of our provinces. Supporters of the current pretender are busy drumming up recruits and calling for the overthrow of the Spanish government. Rooting them out will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT37715OPTA;Excellent work!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME37716;The Christinos Prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37716;The capital has been overrun, the pretender king driven into the provinces, and the original royal line descending from Ferdinand VII has been restored to the Spanish throne. Many liberals are breathing a sigh of relief, but reactionaries are furious. Already supporters of the pretender are seeking new allies in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37717;The supporters of the former royal line still exist, and we have begun to receive reports of a Christino cell having been established in one of our provinces. They are gaining a great deal of support among liberals in the province with their calls for an overthrow of the 'pretender' on the throne.

EVTNAME37720;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37720;The death of Leopoldo O'Donnell has eroded Queen Isabella's support, to the point where a movement to overthrow her has rapidly developed. A mutiny by naval officers in Cadiz has provided the spark for a widespread revolt against Isabella's rule. Her chief minister and generals have deserted her, and Isabella was forced to flee into exile. For the moment, Spain stands without a ruler, and the provisional government argues over what its next step should be. Some favor abandoning the monarchy altogether, but most feel a new king should be selected. Isabella's heir, Prince Alfonso, is thought by many to be too much under her influence. Other choices are the moderate Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern and the liberal Prince Amadeo of Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT37720OPTA;Give the crown to Prince Amadeo of Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37721;The Spanish Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37721;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch to assume the throne... and among the candidates considered was Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. Our government objected strongly to the move, as this would spread Prussian influence to our southern border, and while this did convince Prince Leopold to turn down the throne it has not endeared us to the Prussians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT37721OPTA;A German prince on the Spanish throne? Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37725;The Hohenzollern king of Spain, controversial since his ascension to the throne and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, was shot dead in his carriage shortly after arriving in Madrid following a country outing.

EVTDESC37730;King Amadeo, controversial since his ascension and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, has angrily declared Spain to be 'ungovernable' after the Hidalgo Affair forced him into conflict with the nation's military and has abdicated the throne.

EVTNAME37735;A Return to Bourbon Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37735;The Spanish Republic has been contentious since its inception. After a series of failed governments, many Spaniards have come to favor a return to the stability of Bourbon rule. In a coup led by Brigadier General Martinez Campos, the Republican army has declared its allegiance to Prince Alfonso -- son of the exiled Queen Isabella II -- and named him King of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97150;An alarming incident has occurred at the Talambó hacienda in Ica. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who has subsequently demanded the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Considering it was not long ago that $COUNTRY$ fought for its independence from Spain, submitting to such an indignity would go over less than well with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident.

EVTDESC97681;The warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them.

EVTNAME97677;The Korean Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea.

EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion.

EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima.

At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible.

EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama.

EVTNAME10210_NEW;Liberal Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10215;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10215;Nationalists in $COUNTRY$, inspired by the wave of liberalism in a neighbouring nation, have risen up. Agitators are running through the streets waving flags and calling for their brethren to fight for freedom. Responding with violence could inflame the entire state, but $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials agree that this cannot be allowed to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10215OPTA;Revolution is like the plague.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10216;Nationalist Fervour in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10216;Nationalists in $PROVINCENAME$, inspired by the wave of liberalism throughout $COUNTRY$, have risen up. Agitators are running through the streets waving flags and calling for their brethren to fight for freedom. Responding with violence could inflame the entire state, but $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials agree that this cannot be allowed to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10216OPTA;Crush them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10216OPTB;Make promises of reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10170_NEW;Like rats carrying contagious diseases, the preachers of modernity move effortlessly back and forth across our borders. Liberal agitation has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighbouring province and is now threatening to inflame the entire state. We might want to send some troops here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10200_NEW;'Death to the $MONARCHTITLE$!', a hoarse voice cries. The streets in $PROVINCENAME$ have come alive. A local injustice, or the perception of one, have animated the unwashed masses into rebellion against our rule and threatens to spread to the rest of the state. The revolt is still small enough that its future course has not been set in stone, and leniency might avert it, but perhaps it is best to put our foot down firmly to set an example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10221;Chartist Rally in Kennington Common;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10221;A massive demonstration by the Chartists has taken place in Kennington Common, with liberals demanding that the People's Charter be implemented immediately-- giving equal votes to all men, rich or poor, as well as secret ballots and a fair distribution of constituencies. Many in the government are suggesting that such public gatherings should be made illegal, and that at best the British government should make empty promises to these rabble-rousers. Others fear that refusing their demands will lead to the monarchy being toppled by rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10221OPTA;Implement the People's Charter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10221OPTB;Shut them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME10225;Hungarian Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10225;The Hungarian Diet has grown increasingly independent of Austrian rule in recent years. Field Marshall Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg was sent to Hungary to take personal control over their armies, but was attacked upon his arrival. In response, the Austrian government ordered the Hungarian Diet dissolved and the Ban of Croatia installed in Lamberg's place. The Hungarians have refused to obey, and thus we now face civil war to maintain the integrity of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10225OPTA;We will restore order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10225OPTB;We have no choice but to let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10225OPTC;Throw off Hapsburg rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10226;Freedom At Last!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10226;We have won our freedom from Austrian rule! The people have gathered in $CAPITAL$ in jubilation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10226OPTA;A new age has begun!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10227;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10227;Hungarian lands rightfully belong to us. With their new-found freedom, we are left with the decision whether we should pursue our claim to their lands or instead try to reconcile with the Hungarian government. If they remain hostile, after all, and we are unable to defeat them, they will become a very dangerous enemy on our border. Admitting their loss, however, might be a blow to our prestige we will never recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10227OPTA;Hungary belongs to Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10227OPTB;We must pursue reconciliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10228;Constitutional Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10228;With the entire nation ready to overthrow the monarchy, ministers have approached the King with advice on reforming the constitution before it's too late. The loss of Belgium has made a revision necessary already. Including provisions that permitted the direct election of the lower house as well as numerous freedoms the Dutch do not already enjoy might pacify the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10228OPTA;We have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10228OPTB;Some limited freedoms are acceptable, but no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10228OPTC;Never! Shut the liberals down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10229;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10229;With the people seemingly ready to break down our doors, demanding constitutional reform, perhaps we should consider giving it to them? Some moderate reforms, allowing the masses their vote but retaining ultimate power for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy and the Kaiser, should please them enough to dispel this rabble... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10229OPTA;Give them limited reforms, if it pleases them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT10229OPTB;Make promises, but work to undermine them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Applies For Statehood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16401;Yesterday morning we received a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, requesting Statehood in the Federal Republic of Central America. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundaries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our prosperous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16401OPTA;We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16401OPTB;We refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16500;Second Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16500;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. This has led to demands for a second constitutional convention and a change to a more proportional system of government based on population -- a demand adamantly opposed by the south, and not universally supported even in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16500OPTA;The convention will move forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16500OPTB;The constitution shall not be amended to appease abolitionists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16501;Dissatisfaction in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16501;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. Despite the move to more proportional government, things have not changed and thus there is talk that perhaps it is the north that needs to secede into a new union based on the freedom of men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16501OPTA;And what will this achieve, exactly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16505;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, fueled by outrage over the changes to the American constitution which have stripped states of their equality. Local sentiments seem to be turning towards the south even though $STATENAME$ is not a slave state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16506;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, as liberals spread loud complaints over their dissatisfaction with the deadlock in the senate. They speak of a new Union based in the north, based on the true freedom the founding fathers intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16510;The Free States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16510;A convention of northern delegates have convened in Philadelphia to announce the formation of a new union: the Free States of America, free of slavery and dedicated to true freedom for all men. The 'true' American government has decreed this the act of traitors, and already is assembling its military to crush the northern secessionists. The so-called Free American government, however, is calling on patriots to rebel against a government held hostage to southern aristocrats and hidebound thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16510OPTA;We support the Free Americans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16510OPTB;The rebels shall be dealt with swiftly and mercilessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16515;The Union Sundered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16515;The civil war is over... and we have lost. The United States of America that was is now gone. Delegates in $CAPITAL$ have convened to urge the government to put aside the former constitution, declaring it irrelevant for the reality that now faces us. A new constitution is being drafted, one heralding our place as master of the South, though there are yet some who say our destiny must one day be retaken and that not all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT16515OPTA;All of America will be retaken. We swear it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97550;The Federal Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97550;The Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one. \n \n §RNOTE: If rebels hold the capital of their country for more than 60 days, that country will declare independence.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97551;Costa Rica Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in San Jose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97552;Nicaragua Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97552;With rebels in Honduras having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Nicaragua.

EVTNAME975521;Honduras Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC975521;With rebels rampant in the south, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Honduras. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Comayagua.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97553;Order Restored in El Salvador;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97556OPTA;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97560;End of the Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97560;The Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of Guatemala declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97560OPTA;We will fight to preserve the republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97560OPTB;The republic must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32550;The Belize Purchase?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32550;Central American delegates have recently come in from London in hopes of purchasing British Belize. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT32550OPTA;We gladly accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT32550OPTB;We refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32551;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME32552;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32552;$MONARCHTITLE$, negotiations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ over Belize have stalled, and they have declined to sell us the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME44122;Webster–Ashburton Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44122;We have concluded a treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, resolving several long-standing border disputes between our nations. In particular, the treaty has clearly established the border between Maine and the British colony of New Brunswick.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44122OPTA;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44125;The Western Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44125;Mexico is not properly utilizing the lands between ours and the Pacific. It is our destiny to bring American rule and prosperity to all of North America, and our responsibility to take these lands from Mexico so they may flourish. To avoid further war with Mexico, we should approach their government and see if they will consider selling these lands to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44126;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Northwest Territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44126;The American ambassador has informed us that it would be in our best interests to sell the lands north of the Rio Grande to the United States. The amount they offer is considerable, and the northwest territories are of limited value to us, but it is almost an insult that they would think us so eager to give up our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44126OPTA;No. That land is rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44126OPTB;We cannot afford for this to escalate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44127;Mexico Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44127;The Mexicans have refused our generous offer. Our only recourse is force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44127OPTA;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44127OPTB;We don't need this to come to a war yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC44129;After violence in their home enclave of Nauvoo, Illinois, the Mormons have elected to head west to settle in the Salt Lake Valley where they can practice their faith without hindrance. Led by Brigham Young, the Mormons suffered great hardship but eventually did reach their destination -- and prospered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44129OPTA;Just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44140;The Northern Alaska Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44140;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to inquire about the possibility of purchasing our territory in northern Alaska. The land is not valuable, and since previous $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ claims to the area will no doubt only lead to conflict, we should perhaps consider the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell the Alaskan territory. Considering that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people already consider the territory rightfully ours, many are calling for war to reclaim the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC44142;The Alaskan territory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44145;The Hawaiian Islands Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44145;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to inquire about the possibility of purchasing our Pacific Island territories near Hawaii. The land is not valuable, and previous $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ claims to the area will no doubt only lead to conflict. We should perhaps consider the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC44150;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Oregon Country. The entire region west of the Rockies (called Columbia by the British) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel.

Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabers over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel.

The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for a cession of all the northern territories currently claimed by their country. If we refuse, it may mean many years more of war for us until these Americans get what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44825OPTA;We agree to their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44825OPTB;We refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ceding all American-claimed territory to our control. For now, the relations between our two countries can return to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44826OPTA;A wise move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44827;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44827;Despite having them over the figurative barrel, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused to capitulate to our demands. So much the worse for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44827OPTA;A foolish move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44830;Execution of Emperor Maximilian;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end. Court-martialed and executed by a firing squad, the new republic was declared only days after his death. Benito Juárez has assumed the role of President of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44830OPTA;It was bound to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44835;The Plan of Tuxtepec;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup. Planned in secret with several military officers and announced in Oaxaca, it has disavowed the presidency of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada and installed Diaz as a military-backed dictator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44835OPTA;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44835OPTB;We welcome El Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44840;Santa Anna Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44840;In a surprise development, the leader of Mexico -- General Antonio de Santa Anna himself -- has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty-- even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44840OPTA;Force him to sign the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44840OPTB;Execute him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44841;In a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory -- separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44841OPTA;Honor the treaty and negotiate for Santa Anna's return.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44841OPTB;Call a ceasefire -- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44841OPTC;Continue the war. Let the Americans do as they wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44842;The Treaties of Velasco;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44842;While Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned. They will not embarrass themselves further, and have agreed to let us remain free in exchange for Santa Anna's return. For the moment, this means the war with Mexico is over... whether that peace will continue remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44842OPTA;Victory for Texas!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44843;Ceasefire With Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44843;As expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return. They are, however, evidently afraid that the treaties have enough validity that ignoring them would give the Americans an excuse to intervene -- and have called for a ceasefire. How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44843OPTA;This will have to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44844;Mexico Ignores the Treaties;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44844;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco -- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44844OPTA;Appeal to the Americans for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44844OPTB;We will fight this out on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44845;War With Mexico!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44845;Despite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door… but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44846;The Texan Diplomat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44846;A diplomat has arrived in Washington from Texas -- a part of the Mexican frontier, settled by southerners who had been offered land by the Mexican government and who then rebelled against its tyranny. The diplomat has asked for American intervention in their war, claiming that a treaty had been worked out with Mexico which they then of course immediately refuted. It seems like shaky grounds… but do we turn our backs on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44846OPTA;Tell them we will do what we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44846OPTB;They are on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME96100;The Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fuelled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Our governors in the region are understandably nervous, and report that we can expect major rebellions in the coming years unless we are very careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT96100OPTA;Put them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT96100OPTB;Perhaps self-governance will make them happy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT96101OPTA;They think this will make us happy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96102;The Arab Revolt has begun, and many people in $CAPITAL$ are flying the revolt flag. They are demanding freedom from foreigner rule, and we will have difficulty keeping them under control... provided that's what we wish to do, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT96102OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME96105;End of the Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96105;The general insurgency by $COUNTRY$'s Arab population has been brought to an end. For the moment, peace has been restored and the momentum of the Arab resistance dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME96106;Arab Uprising in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96106;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Mashriqi tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down. The $PROVINCENAME$ governor made a point of displaying their bodies, hoping that would discourage others from following suit. It hasn't. Arab outrage has been fanned throughout $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME96110;The House of Saud Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96110;Abdul-Aziz, scion of the House of Saud, has returned from exile in Kuwait. Not only that, the man has managed to forge an alliance with the southern Bedouin tribes and retaken Riyadh. We must deal with ibn Saud quickly, lest he retake even more land and reverse our earlier victory over his house.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97170;The Mahdist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism -- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97170OPTA;This could be trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97171;Mahdists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader's jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98725;The Call for Arab Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98725;The call has gone out across the world: a nation has risen to lead the Arab masses into the future, a greater power that can withstand the onslaught of colonialism by the European powers. They must rise up and join $COUNTRY$, or forever spend their lives as servants to foreign masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95260;The Disunited States;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95260;With the end of the democratic government of the United States, there is a growing feeling among many Americans that the principles upon which the country were founded no longer apply. Talk of secession is frequent, if quiet, and as unrest begins to grow it's become increasingly more possible that liberal-minded states will attempt to pull out of the Union. If they do, we must be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95260OPTA;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95261;The Sons of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95261;A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has secretly formed in $PROVINCENAME$, advocating either the overthrow of the totalitarian American regime or the secession of $STATENAME$ from the Union. American law-enforcement is doing its best to hunt down these traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We delegates hereby declare ourselves the inheritors of that once-great legacy, and forever more shall we be known as the Free States of America.' \n \n With those words,delegates from several states in the north have gathered in Philadelphia and declared their secession from the Union. Whether we can move fast enough to ensure those states never act upon the declaration, or whether others will heed the call of these so-called 'Free States' remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95266;The Congress of $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95266;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Free States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No longer can the South remain under the heel of the North and call it freedom -- the Confederacy must rise again!' \n \n With those words, a large group of delegates gathered in Richmond have declared the Confederate States of America reborn. At least one state has agreed to secede, and its possible that others will join them… now or very soon. If we are to stop this new rebellion, we will need to act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Oregon Country is a land where men achieve their destiny through honest toil and while believing in the equality of men. Since the Union no longer believes in the same, we hereby declare it dead.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Portland have declared the secession of Oregon from the Union. While other parts of the region may join them, it's unknown whether everyone there feels the same. Clearly this rebellion must be stopped before it gains further traction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is what we do here today: we are forging a new alliance of equals, brothers with a common heritage who will never forget the evils that lie in tyranny and corruption.' \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Chicago have declared the formation of a 'New American Alliance'. The state of Illinois has seceded from the Union to create it, and it's entirely possible that others will join them if we do not act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC36716;Our forces have consolidated their control over Amsterdam and proven their superiority in the war, and thus the Dutch government has little choice but to accept any terms we dictate.

EVTNAME44305;Rebellions of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion. They are frustrated by the lack of political reform, as well as the entrenched power held by the reactionary elites of the 'Family Compact', and agitators are demanding responsible government if not outright independence. The colonial government has moved to arrest the perpetrators as traitors to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, it is entirely possible the Canadian radicals could attract support from the Americans if they are not appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land -- all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario -- being given offered to the Canadian dominion. Currently the land is administered by the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus the Canadian government would be required to purchase it. Should they choose to do so, it would strengthen our ally greatly and relieve our overextended colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT44325OPTB;We have no interest in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44339;The land north of the 60th parallel is inhospitable to settlers, but there is a growing concern that should the Canadian government not move to fully claim the territory another power will do so.

EVTDESC44351;Representatives from British Columbia have met with Canadian delegates in $CAPITAL$ to discuss terms of their joining confederation. The only thing that appears to interest them is the building of a national railway linking the Pacific and the Atlantic. Without it, they say, the nation is too divided and they are more connected with other regions along the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT44351OPTA;We accept their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC44356;The second stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Calgary to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed.

EVTDESC44357;After a massive effort expended to create a pass through the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian National Railway has been completed!

EVTNAME49501;Reforming the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49501;Members of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government have approached us, suggesting that the Kalmar Union must be resurrected. For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here.

Imam Shamil and the Chechen Muslims are leading raids from the highlands and forests, this frontier region promises brew problems in the near future. \n \n To consolidate our hold in one of the provinces of the region, the fort of Yekaterinodar will not be the capital of the province anymore and the recently founded port city of Novorossiysk will be the new regional capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalising the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Russian recently approached us, all smiles and willingness to co-operate. They have offered to make the current status quo official: Sakhalin will have a border drawn dividing it in two.

Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia.

Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.

The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. American newspapers have leapt on the event, painting pictures of Spanish atrocities which have whipped up the public into a rage. People are calling for war against Spain and intervention in Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as 'the Propaganda Movement'.

EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion -- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME33006;Trade For Heligoland?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33006;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposition: a trade of one of our colonial states in exchange for the island of Heligoland.

EVT33006OPTA;We agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC33009;The lands of Alsace-Lorraine rightfully belong in the hands of the German people.

EVTDESC33020;The German Kaiser has sent a delegation to $COUNTRY$ with a proposal: a resurrection of the Holy Alliance formed between Prussia, Austria and Russia which once existed after the defeat of Napoleon. It seems doubtful that such an alliance could bear fruit, but perhaps it is time to consider this idea. $COUNTRY$ has other concerns than constant conflict with the Germans, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME33025;The Spanish Pacific;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33025;With the loss of our colonial base in Manila, the administration of the Pacific Islands has become incredibly difficult. We have been approached by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the possibility of selling any of our remaining holdings in the Caroline and Mariana Islands. The amount offered is not much, but then again the islands are not worth much - indeed, they cost us far more than they provide. There is the additional notion that, should we disagree, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might attempt to take them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT33025OPTA;Agree to sell them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT33025OPTB;We are not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME33030;The German East Africa Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33030;The Society for German Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the German East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in. The Sultan of Zanzibar will doubtlessly object if we do, as he claims authority over the coast -- even if his actual authority is minimal -- but so what if he does? This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT33030OPTA;Claim the coast as a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT33030OPTB;We have no interest in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME33031;German Warships!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33031;For the last several years, Swahili tribes on the coast have been making treaties with Europeans, allowing them to create small settlements. We knew this would be trouble, and we were right. Powerful warships have arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, a demonstration of their power as they make a demand for the entirety of the coast. If we do this, they say, we shall be safe from further molestation -- and they claim we do not truly control the coast anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVT33031OPTA;An outrage! We refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVT33031OPTB;It seems we have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVT33035OPTA;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98200;The Great Boer Trek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the north-east, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98200OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98205;Invasion of the Laagers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98205OPTA;We must drive them from our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98205OPTB;There is no choice but to appease them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98206;The Battle of Blood River;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony -- with the only question remaining whether the British will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98206OPTA;They are colonial subjects, no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98206OPTB;The Boers will stand on their own, if they can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98207;The Natalia Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are British subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98207OPTB;Allow them to find their own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98210;British Rule of Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under British rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the British crown. There have been several altercations with British military forces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98210OPTA;We will annex the Natal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98210OPTB;Let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98211;Natalian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, the British crown has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from the British now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98211OPTA;We will maintain good relations with the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98211OPTB;The Boer will find their own way -- without help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98212;The Annexation of Natalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the British government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to leave the British behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98212OPTA;We will not submit to British rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98212OPTB;We have no choice. We cannot fight the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98213;The Boers Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT98213OPTB;Natalia is not worth fighting over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98215;The Orange River Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Orange River valley and established a new colony-- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98215OPTA;An interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98216;The Boers Overtake the Orange Valley;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98216;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Orange Valley and declared it their own.

EVTNAME98225;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98230;Sand River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98230OPTA;We will abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98231;Orange River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98236;Kimberley Gold Rush;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas -- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98235OPTA;They are proving to be a nuisance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98240;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98241;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT98241OPTB;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98245;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrassing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98245OPTA;They will submit, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98247OPTA;Let us reconcile with the Boers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT98249OPTA;We shall accept their surrender nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98250;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced.

EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony.

EVT98255OPTA;This is beyond the pale!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials.

EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux -- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church -- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessal which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea -- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85000OPTA;This cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries -- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves.

EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home -- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrespect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85010OPTA;Demand an apology as well as the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85010OPTB;This is not in our interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress -- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation -- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85011OPTA;There is nothing we can do. Sign the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85011OPTB;Never! Let them do their worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85012;A Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress -- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85012OPTA;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85013;The Korean government has caved to our delegation and signed the Treaty of Ganghwa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85013OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85014;The Korean government has thumbed its nose at our delegation. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people cry out for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85014OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85015;Korean Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85015;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85015OPTA;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85020;Tonghak Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85020OPTA;This cannot be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85021;Tonghak Rebellion Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored -- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea -- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85025OPTA;We must intervene in Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85025OPTB;They are on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85026;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Intervenes in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese -- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85026OPTA;Overthrow the Korean government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85026OPTB;This is not the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85027;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Enter Seoul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85027OPTA;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85028OPTA;War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85028OPTB;This is not the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85029;Chinese Intervene in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act -- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98620;Christian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98620;The Ottoman government had a number of policies regarding the treatment of Christians within the Empire which were considered oppressive: the capitulation tax, known as the Jizya, as well as controls over Christians which did not permit them to become soldiers or hold public office. It was not until the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856-- also known as the Imperial Reform Edict, part of the Tanzimat Reforms-- that things actually began to improve for minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98620OPTA;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98625;The Kanûn-i Esâsî;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98625;A group of liberal intellectuals known as the 'Young Ottomans', led by the statesman reformer Midhat Pasha and influenced by the Liberal Revolutions elsewhere in Europe, have proposed a new constitution -- the 'Kanûn-i Esâsî' or 'Basic Law' -- which would see an elected parliament created, would limit the powers of the Sultan, and speed up the Tanzimat Reforms. Conservative members of the Ottoman government claim that giving into these liberals will only speed up the erosion of long-held traditions, while others say that the reforms are sorely needed to stave off the decline of the Empire at the hands of nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98625OPTA;Tradition will be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98625OPTB;Implement the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98626;The Empire in Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants -- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force -- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98626OPTA;Order must be restored. Abrogate the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98626OPTB;Reform must move forward, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98630;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98630OPTA;This cannot be permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98635;The Young Turks;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalised into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the constitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98635OPTA;We cannot allow them to spread unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98635OPTB;Let them talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98636;Turkish Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy -- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98636OPTA;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98640;End of the Ottoman Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favor of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98640OPTA;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97500OPTA;Russia protects the Holy Land, not France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97500OPTB;We will agree to the French demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97501OPTA;Pressure them into accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97501OPTB;Abandon our claim before this goes further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97502OPTA;We must give in to the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97502OPTB;Never! Let them come, if they dare!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97503OPTA;We are the protectors of Eastern Christians, not the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places -- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97504OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97505OPTA;This will surely lead to trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97506OPTA;We intend to stay out of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97506OPTB;We will protect our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet -- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97507OPTA;A dark day for the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97507OPTB;Never! There is still a chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current war goals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97508OPTA;We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97508OPTB;We refuse. The war continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97509;The Russians Have Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97509;The Russians have agreed to lay down arms. Now comes the difficult part: discovering how they wish to punish us with the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97509OPTA;A great relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97512OPTA;There shall be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97510;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail) and that we will renounce our claims in the area. Other demands are that we cede the territory of the Åland Islands to Finland as demilitarized zone. Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97510OPTA;Give them Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97510OPTB;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97511;Stand Down;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97511;The Ottomans have surrendered to the Russians. There is no need for our war to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97511OPTA;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97515;Romanian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our independence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97515OPTA;We shall declare our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97515OPTB;No, it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97516OPTA;We will assist the Romanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97516OPTB;We are not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97517;The Russians Have Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97518;The Russians Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97520;Romania Is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97520;The Russians have kept their part of the bargain. We should keep ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97521OPTA;A dark day for Romania.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97525OPTA;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97525OPTB;Let Romania go. We cannot afford a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95610;The Great Game;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95610;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95610OPTA;It remains a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95610OPTB;This is not in our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95611;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion.

EVTNAME95612;The Great Game Comes To $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95612OPTA;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95613;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Border Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its manoeuvring, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95613OPTA;Use the excuse to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37219_NEW;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In Dai Nam, the execution of several missionaries has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention.

EVTNAME37230;The Kingdom of Pomare;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37230;The island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, ruled by the primitive Queen Pomare IV," expelled two French catholic priests several years ago. Admiral Abel Aubert Dupetit-Thouars was dispatched to get reparations for the deed, but then proceeded -- without authorization -- to gain a request from the Queen's chiefs to request a protectorate", a treaty to which he then demanded the Queen acquiesce. We can approve the treaty, gaining use of Tahiti as a staging ground in the Pacific, but it may cause friction with the British Empire considering British colonists are also on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC10400;The unrest in France hit its height recently, with crowds streaming through the streets of Paris and erecting barricades. In what was widely regarded as an accident, a French guardsmen fired his musket on the citizens and set off a massacre. The resulting conflagration has swept the city, with crowds chanting 'Long live the Reform!' and 'Down with the King!'. Despite assurances that everything is under control, the king has abdicated and fled the country… leaving a provisional government to step in and declare the Second Republic. \n \n Now we have the task of building this new government, starting with a presidential election to determine its new Head of State.

EVTNAME10401;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10401;While it was expected that Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte would do well in the French presidential election, no one could have counted on the fact that he has done as well as this. Despite his autocratic leanings and lack of allies in Paris, he has managed to be something to everyone… even gaining the sponsorship of the Orleanists. The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city -- leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal suffrage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents. Either way, the ideals of the Second Republic seem at risk of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC10402;Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte has swept into power as France's new Head of State. The man carries with him the legacy of his infamous uncle, and with it the support of the masses.

EVTDESC10405;Unable to force the Upper House to repeal its prohibition against presidential re-election and facing removal from power, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC10410;The popularity of Louis-Napoleon has waned. Where once it was expected that his ascension would return France to the greatness it experienced during the reign of his uncle, instead France sees itself being eclipsed by its neighbours. The Emperor has cultivated many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they have chosen their moment to strike. Napoleon has been deposed, and the only question remains as to what form France shall now take. Shall we restore the Bourbon dynasty under the Count of Chambord, elect for a Bourbon constitutional monarchy under the Comte de Paris, or instead opt to create the Third Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mourned by the entire nation, and by his beloved Empress Eugénie, the question now turns to who will follow him.

EVTNAME1010011;The Great Irish Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME1010015;The Young Irelander Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control... and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence.

EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent -- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed.

EVTNAME90060;The Eastern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90060OPTA;We will host the Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90060OPTB;This is unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90061;Planning for the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90061OPTA;The Ottoman Empire must be kept strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90061OPTB;Stability in the Balkans is most important.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90062;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to carve up our nation, and an insult, but regardless we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90062OPTA;Our representatives shall attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90063;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to bolster the shaky Empire's hold over the Middle East and balk Russian 'aggression'. Either way, we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90064;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans.

This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90064OPTA;We will not risk our relationship with the Ottomans for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900640;The Cyprus Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900640;An idea has arisen within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: could we perhaps offer our support to the Ottomans in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for a lease on Cyprus? Our support could make a great deal of difference for them... and the island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance. The Ottomans could use all the support they can get, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900640OPTA;Make the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900640OPTB;We have no interest in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with a proposal: they will lend their support to us in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for Cyprus. The island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance, after all, and while some might consider the offer an insult there are others who suggest that without this offer it's just as likely the island will be offered to Greece. $FROMCOUNTRY$ could ensure it isn't... and we could use all the allies in the Congress we can get.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900641OPTA;Agree to the deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900641OPTB;No. Cyprus is not a bargaining chip.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900642;The Deal is Struck;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900642;The Ottomans have agreed to the lease of Cyprus. Now we just need to make sure that we do all we can to make sure the Ottomans are kept strong...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900642OPTA;We shall do our best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900643;The Ottomans Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900643;The Ottomans have refused our offer. Evidently they will take their chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900643OPTA;We accept their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900643OPTB;Then they shall receive no support from us whatsoever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900645;The Bosnian Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900645;$COUNTRY$ has a reasonable issue to bring before the upcoming Congress: while it seems beyond question that the Bosnians will be given independence, we could make a case for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ stewardship over Bosnia at the Congress and it seems likely we would be heeded... though it would, without a doubt, upset the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900645OPTA;Make the claim at the Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90065OPTA;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90067OPTA;We will abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90067OPTB;Never! $COUNTRY$ will not be ordered about!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consensus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90069OPTA;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress.

EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90071OPTA;They will pay for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90071OPTB;We have no desire to push this further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900700;Giving Up Cyprus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900700;We are called upon to live up to our part of the bargain and give up Cyprus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900700OPTA;We will abide by our agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900700OPTB;Their help was worthless! Forget it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900701;The Cyprus Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900701;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to live up to its part of the bargain and hand over Cyprus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900701OPTA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900702;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Reneges;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900702;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has reneged on its deal to give up Cyprus. They claim our aid at the Congress wasn't worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900702OPTA;Then we shall take it whether they like it or not!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900702OPTB;It's not worth fighting over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900705;The Bosnian Stewardship;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900705;The Congress has agreed to our demands regarding Bosnia. They are to be placed under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME900710;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Allies;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900710;$FROMCOUNTRY$ received a great deal of benefit from the recent Congress of great powers, and it was decided that $COUNTRY$ deserves great influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as compensation -- if we want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900710OPTA;Absolutely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900710OPTB;We have no interest in influencing $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC900712;$FROMCOUNTRY$ received a great deal of benefit from the recent Congress of great powers, and it was decided that $COUNTRY$ deserves considerable some small influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as compensation -- if we want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME900715;Legacy of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900715;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ delegates were sent to the recent Congress -- reasonable considering it was the fate of our country and the entire Balkans that was being decided, or so we thought. As it turns out, the great powers of Europe decided what was to become of $COUNTRY$ without our participation, and while we received some benefit it has come to us at a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT900715OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership -- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009872OPTA;This could mean trouble down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME152009873;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Military Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings -- not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$'s new rulers. They claim that $COUNTRY$ is in a state of 'upheaval', and only the army can restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009873OPTA;The army shall rule $COUNTRY$ for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT152009873OPTB;We will not stand for military rule in $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them -- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95639OPTA;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95640;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95640OPTA;Demand Cochinchina, or it is war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95640OPTB;We will continue on the diplomatic path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95641OPTA;Turn over Cochinchina. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95641OPTB;They are a paper tiger. Let them come, if they dare.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95642;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95642;The rulers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have foolishly refused our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95642OPTA;Then war it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95645;The Suzerainty of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95645OPTA;Ask for French protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95645OPTB;Throw out the Thai! We will risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95646;The King of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95646OPTA;Demand Cambodia from the Vietnamese.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95646OPTB;Cambodia is on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95648;Dai Nam Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95648;Dai Nam has refused to surrender Cambodia to us. It seems we have little choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95648OPTA;War it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95649;France Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95649;The French have refused to intervene. It seems we are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95649OPTA;Then we declare our freedom. We shall risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95649OPTB;Then we do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95650;French Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95650OPTA;It remains a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95650OPTB;This is not in our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95650OPTC;Never bring this up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet… do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95652OPTA;We have no choice. Surrender the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95652OPTB;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ stubbornly refuses to relinquish hold over its conquered lands. It falls on us to protet these unfortunates by use of force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95653OPTA;A foolish move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has bowed before our demand. Good relations have been restored..;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95654OPTA;A wise move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95655;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95655OPTA;Give them what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95655OPTB;That will solve nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95656;The Dai Viet Emperor Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95656;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us a state as concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95656OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95657;The Dai Viet Emperor has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95657;The Dai Viet have refused to submit. Apparently they will fight until the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95657OPTA;An unfortunate choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME185;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prohibition?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC185;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants. Many of their more politically-minded members have even approached members of the government in $CAPITAL$, pushing for greater support for their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT185OPTA;Support the movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT185OPTB;Nonsense. They take this too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME186;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Libertines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC186;The libertine culture in $COUNTRY$ has drawn criticism, with news of a scandal that reaches to the very heights of government. Several ministers are accused of unsavoury dealings, and there are calls in $CAPITAL$ for the government to support religious groups in their calls for moderation and temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT186OPTA;There is no need for such action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT186OPTB;Some restraint is best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18210;The Right to Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTA;Let the bill pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTB;That will cause too many problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTC;Don't bring this up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18215;Party Loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18215OPTA;We must have unity in the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18215OPTB;No. Let the government rule as it desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18220;The Right to Information;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18225;The Right to Gather;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated -- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18225OPTA;They are right. We cannot abide this sort of rabble-rousing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18225OPTB;No, the rules shall stay as they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18230;Rights of the Opposition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98600;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98600OPTA;We will make the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98600OPTB;There is no point.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98605;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand.

EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion -- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98606OPTA;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98607;$COUNTRY$ Granted Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98607OPTA;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98608;It appears the threat of a war of independence was enough to secure $COUNTRY$'s freedom. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98610OPTA;Then it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98610OPTB;We shall let them go. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98611OPTA;Attempt to find allies... quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded.

EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90075OPTA;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90076;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90076OPTA;Egypt is part of the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90076OPTB;We are willing to negotiate a settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90077OPTA;We agree to the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90077OPTB;Never! We reject all Ottoman influence in Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine -- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90078OPTA;This is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90079;Egypt Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90079OPTA;So must it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90080;The Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90080OPTA;Glory to Egypt!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90081;Egypt Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90081;We have brought Egypt to its knees and restored Ottoman rule to the area. Now we must decide whether to be gracious and allow them to retain autonomy, while restricting their land and power, or whether to rule all of Egypt directly and face the possibility of rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90081OPTA;Restrict their lands and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90081OPTB;We shall rule them directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90082;Rebellion Against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90082;An uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ has gained popularity throughout the region, spreading the unrest throughout all of $STATENAME$. Local authorities have moved swiftly in an attempt to keep the violence contained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90082OPTA;Put down the uprising at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90083;Anger Over Egyptian Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms, and there are fears that if they are not satisfied they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90083OPTA;We will give in to their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90083OPTB;The government will not submit to reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair -- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90084OPTA;Withdraw our support for the Ottomans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT90086OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90087;The Fall of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT90087OPTB;Never! We hold out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90088;The Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control.

EVT90088OPTA;We accept their surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT90088OPTB;There will be no peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90089;End of the Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now.

EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC800089;A violent incident has occurred at our embassy in $FROMCOUNTRY$, spurred on by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ resentment towards $COUNTRY$ and our ideology.

EVTNAME800090;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Does Not Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800090;Despite our apology, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it is enraged by the incident and that our lack of control over our citizens is to blame. While they are seen as being unreasonably aggressive, war is even a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800147;Sepoy Rebels Force Concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800147;The Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports.

EVTDESC800148;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in our region has come to an end, thanks to the spread of the Sepoy Rebellion.

EVTDESC800149;After a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97700OPTB;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in a neighbouring country, and have gained sufficient control that they have sent word they wish to bring the province back to $COUNTRY$. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97567;Danger Passed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97567;The danger of imminent overthrow has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties -- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97566;Trouble in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$.

EVTNAME97570;Native Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97570;Now that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony.

EVT97570OPTA;They are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, not 'foreigners'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17710;Communist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17710;Communists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society. Government officials are concerned, and some say that we need to crack down hard on this kind of talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17715;The Common Man;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17715;Socialist leanings have become quite prevalent in parts of $COUNTRY$, and among these socialists radical ideas have been spreading -- namely that the common man can only achieve true freedom by overthrowing the government and establishing a rule by the working class. They cite the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as tyrannical, and one that will never bend to true reform... and the people have been listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17720;Communist Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17720;The tense situation in one of our states has been aggravated by the presence of communist agitators, spurring on the working classes to rise up against the government and institute a rule by the workers. We could step in, but that might only provoke a rebellion. Allowing the agitators to continue spreading their propaganda, however, might let them get a stronger foothold in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17730;Communists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17730;A communist demonstration in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, with shouts decrying the state of workers in $COUNTRY$, has gained the communists a great deal of attention and sympathy throughout $STATENAME$. Attempting to crack down on these agitators may only cause the demonstrations to turn into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97175OPTA;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighbouring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME19365;The Restoration of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19365;An idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not?

EVTDESC19366;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands. With $COUNTRY_ADJ$, they say, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will prove a much worthier ally.

EVTDESC19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to consider our proposal. It's possible they will, in the end, take no military action on our behalf… it's come to our attention that relations between them and one of our neighbours has cooled severely, however, so a war may yet come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19367OPTA;Then there is hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to intervene on our behalf.

Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again?

EVTNAME19301;The Dream Is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19301;There was once a dream in this country - a dream of a land of liberty, of new opportunities. People would flock to the United States of America seeking freedom, opportunities and shelter from the horrors of war and intolerance of the old world. The Statue of Liberty, the USA proudest symbol, used to symbolize that, and that was the first thing immigrants saw when entering our country. The Statue is still there, standing ominously in the bay of New York, but it doesn't represent that dream anymore, nor any of the values it used to. With the recrudescence of the institutions in our country, the change from a democratic government, the Statue lost all meaning and people from all over the world stopped being enchanted by what it represented. \n \n The dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37236;Work on the foundations of the Eiffel Tower began. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block built of limestone each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were complete by $YEAR$ and the erection of the ironwork began. For this part, we need to set a budget for the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37237;The Eiffel Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37237;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large French flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME3697000;The Construction of the Clock Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC3697000;During the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the fire of 1834, the parliament determined that the new buildings should incorporate an impressive clock tower and passed a bill to that end in $YEAR$. This clock tower will take years to be built but it will be a massive accomplishment for out country. The only thing left for the building to start is to define the budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME3697001;The Clock Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC3697001;The completion of the Clock Tower marks the end of the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster. The clock tower was constructed on the northern extremity of the new Houses of Parliament that were built next to Westminster Hall. The commission for the clock itself demanded a high level of accuracy, the specifications drafted by the Royal Astronomer required that "the first stroke of the hour bell should register the time, correct to within one second per day, and furthermore that it should telegraph its performance twice a day to Greenwich Observatory, where a record would be kept." The second and final version of the hour bell was the largest ever cast in the UK. It was so colossal that a team of 16 horses was needed to pull the wagon upon which it rested from the foundry to the Tower. The transportation took on the character of a parade, with enthusiastic crowds lining the streets as the caravan made its way through London. The bell and tower got nicknamed "Big Ben".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC800012;We have been secretly approached by certain members within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, suggesting that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention to free them from foreign control might be in both our interests. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be free to seek its own destiny, while $COUNTRY$ would gain an ally.

EVTNAME800017;Free At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800017;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has supported the could d'etat in $CAPITAL$, but with the change came an orgy of violence that has seen $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ damaged along with that of our overlord.

EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999003;National Debate: Citizenship Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the town house, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbour has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999010;The Political Campaign Of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999010;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political parties have begun a nationwide election campaign. So far, the effects have been quite limited, but in the end, one party will gain the upper hand. Advisors state that we could try to influence the outcome ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999020;Calm Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occurred in several large factories, with incidents of street fighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999022;Riots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999022;The tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere. Advisors are recommending that the military be brought into the capital to restore order, though doing so will only contain the violence at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999034;The Anarcho-Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999034;It looks like the anarcho liberals, a group of radicals who have taken the liberal ideals to their extreme, have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999035;The Social Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election -- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999036;Reactionary Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999037;Surge of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999040;National Debate: Voting Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999040;Voting rights for the middle class? Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999041;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' While being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999041;Stop these ungrateful wretches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n \n The subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTA999044;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999044;There is no need to change the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999045;Election Fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999045;Want me to play the world's smallest violin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999049;National Debate: Unemployment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999049;The socialists are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999055;The Child Labor Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999065;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT880130OPTA;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME31510;A Greater Austrian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31510;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria's unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans... not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams.

EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2610;$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory-- that is only in dispute by those neighbours who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbours-- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2615;Flags Burned in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them-- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$. Authorities broke up the demonstration, but there continues to be a growing discontent in the area. The turmoil has even spread to other citizens, who have begun calling on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to end its assimilation policies and let the minority groups be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbours with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least-- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2620;Flags Flying in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high -- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2625;$PROVINCENAME$ Assimilated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2625;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. Even those who are members of other cultures no longer consider themselves truly part of our neighbours-- much as those neighbours might be unhappy with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2626;Claims in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2626;$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ program of assimilation has succeeded, however, in weaning our own people away from any feeling as if this true. They no longer consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$, and indeed the international community appears to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2660;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$. \n \n §RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back.

EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems -- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere.

Some are even suggesting the possibility of voter fraud.

EVTNAME80121;Panthay Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80121;Have Peace with Han Chinese! \n Down with Qing court! \n \n A rebellion has erupted in the southern province of Yunnan, led by a rebel named Du Wenxiu. Foreign ambassadors are calling this event the "Panthay Rebellion", a revolt from the Muslims in Yunnan.

EVTDESC90904;Perhaps $FROMCOUNTRY$ has grown beyond our ability to control them? They have been far more welcoming of western ways, to the point that now they consider themselves 'civilized' and on par with the barbarians outside of $COUNTRY$... Indeed, they even consider themselves above us, and have thrown off $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule as if it were a bad shadow. They seek to chart an independent course, but should we let them? Should we allow them to pretend they are not part of China, and reject the heritage of thousand thousand years?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160001;We are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendance of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' and driven out local governors. All within the Qing government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence -- if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor's name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared -- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarrassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness.

EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME160009;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-- and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south.

EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160016;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160016;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the South lands, claiming to speak with the voice of God.

EVTDESC160017;Followers of the 'Heavenly Kingdom' are causing further problems in the south.

EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away -- ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a proper republic is the way forward. Still others say the unthinkable -- that Hong Xiuquan's death is a sign that the Heavenly Kingdom has lost favor with God, and that the only way to restore it is restore the Qing Dynasty to the Imperial throne -- without, of course, allowing the Manchu to rule the south like errant lapdogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160502;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $PROVINCENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1605020;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died-- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16050215;Victory over the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME164503;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164503;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164505;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164505;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller has taken to walking the South lands, claiming to speak with the voice of God.

EVTNAME164599;The Xinhai Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or 'Chinese United League'. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisifed to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What's more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164601;Revolutionary Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$.

EVTNAME99000;The Righteous Harmony Society;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99000;'Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!' \n \n Many Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society -- known to foreigners as 'Boxers' -- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99001;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99001;An attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signalled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$. Already the flags of the Righteous Harmony Society have been spotted, their followers recruiting fellow Chinese to support the Qing government in their struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99005;Attack on Foreigners in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99005;Throughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence. Smugglers, missionaries, opium peddlers… anyone they can apprehend is being slain or forced to flee for their lives. We have a choice: either look the other way, risking anger from the great powers for these 'atrocities', or send in forces to suppress the Boxers and risk the anger of our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99006;Boxer Atrocities in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99006;A group of Chinese nationalists known as the 'Boxers', intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qing government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99010;Boxers Attack Legation Quarter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners -- and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME99011;Boxers Attack $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qing government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99015;The Boxer Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99015;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers.

EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qing magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality -- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these men executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316082;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316082;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well.

While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them a concession port and reparations. Indeed, this might even help us in some ways, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1316175;We have lost all patience with the barbarians who call themselves our 'masters'.

Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316180;Empire of the Great Qing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316180;China has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be.

EVTNAME1316181;The Arrow Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316181;Qing officials recently boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship (a lorcha) that was suspected of piracy and smuggling. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the Qing authorities. British officials have demanded the release of the sailors, however, claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was under their protection. The Imperial court has been enraged by this claim, suggesting that agreeing to British demands would give smugglers free reign throughout China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316182;Qing officials recently boarded the Arrow, a ship that -- according to all reports-- was flying British colors at the time. The Chinese claim this isn't the case, and we've received news that they intend to crack down on the opium trade throughout the Empire. The British government is up in arms, saying that we must exert our influence over the Qing if we are to retain our position in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge -- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The Chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse.

EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces.

EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority.

EVTDESC152009874;Heavy street fighting erupts in the small streets of Paris as $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces advance into in a bid to capture the city. Artillery is moved to the Chaillot Hill, past improvised barriers while infantry run away from the 7th arrondissement and move systematically from house to house, block by block, fighting a running battle against armed irregulars. The Arc de Triomphe is demolished by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ pioneers while the artillery in Chaillot hill set their sights on the Eiffel Tower. For several minutes the city is taken by the roar of artillery until silence falls and the only sound is the screeching of retorted metal slowly bending. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shout excitedly as they watch the Eiffel Tower bend and fall into the Seine, now reduced to an amorphous lump of metal. \n \n Fires rage out of control in the eastern parts of the city, lighting up the skyline as the fighting continues into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The parliament houses in the Palace of Westminster lay empty while $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers run up and down placing explosives in the silent corridors. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ general silently read the orders that came from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital with instructions to destroy the Palace in an attempt to crush the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ spirit. The explosives are detonated at the same time as the Clock Tower bell strike its precise hourly strike. The tower is engulfed by flames as parts of the western palace collapse, with pieces of the Big Ben landing on the Thames along with other debris while nearby buildings are hit by flaming debris and catch fire. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers watch and cherish from a safe distance as the glass that once contained the phrase "DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM" rains on the ground. Nearby, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers storm the Buckingham Palace just to find out that the $MONARCHTITLE$ has already fled the country. They hoist the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ flag and turn to see the smoke rising in the horizon. London is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1001;'Comrades, it is a great fact that the misery of the working masses has not diminished from 1836 to $YEAR$ in $COUNTRY$, and yet this period is unrivaled in the development of its industry and the growth of its commerce. Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased of him. As time passes, all social rules and all relations between individuals are eroded by a cash economy, avarice drags Pluto himself out of the bowels of the earth. In light of this, we want, no, we NEED a free society, where no one is considered to be superior, no one is left behind and where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity. We need a society without a government, without class divisions and where the workers control the means of production. \n The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.';;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME32537;The Rise of Mysticism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32537;Imperial Russia is confronted with a religious renaissance, a widespread interest in spiritual-ethical literature and non-conformist moral-spiritual movements, an upsurge in pilgrimage and other devotions to sacred spaces and objects. The "God-Seeking" are shaping their own ritual and spiritual lives, sometimes in the absence of clergy. The upper class of $CAPITAL$ had=s been widely influenced by this wave of mysticism. Individual aristocrats are reportedly obsessed with anything occult and this new fever for anything mystic has been spreading to the middle class and the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME32538;The Tzar's Son Falls Ill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32538;In $YEAR$, Tsesarevich Alexei, the Tzar's son, received an injury which caused him painful bleeding. When the doctors could not supply a cure, the desperate Tzarina looked for other help. Grigori Rasputin, a peasant who identified as a strannik, a religious wanderer, had already treated other nobles families and came for the desperate Tzarina. Rasputin was said to possess the ability to heal through prayer and was able to calm the parents and to give the boy some relief, in spite of the doctors' prediction that he would die. On the following day the boy showed significant signs of recovery. The careless Alexei received the last sacrament during another particularly grave crisis, and the desperate Tzarina turned to her lady-in-waiting, to secure the help of the peasant healer. The next day, Rasputin responded and sent a short telegram, including the prophecy: "The little one will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much." The boy's temperature dropped and the hematoma disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT32538OPTA;Well, I will be damned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32539;Intrigue in the Russian Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32539;While fascinated by Rasputin in the beginning, the ruling class of $CAPITAL$ became envious and turned against him: he had privileges no one else had. In $YEAR$, within four months, Rasputin had visited the Romanovs six times. The press started a campaign against Rasputin, claiming he paid too much attention to women. Hermogen, who told Rasputin to stay away from the palace, repeated the rumours that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a sect. Iliodor, hinting that Rasputin was Alexandra's paramour, showed Makarov a satchel of letters. The letters were handed to the Tzar and Rodzianko requested Rasputin to leave the capital. When Kokovtsov became prime minister he asked the Tzar permission to authorize Rasputin's exile to Tobolsk, but Nicholas refused: "I know Rasputin too well to believe all the tittle-tattle about him." Kokovtsov offered Rasputin 200,000 rubles for him to leave the capital, but he refused. Rasputin had become one of the most hated persons in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC32540;After much time spent debating it, the Tzar was finally convinced to exile Rasputin. Tzarina Alexandra is inconsolable, blaming the Tzar if anything happens to their son. The Russian nobility and clergy rejoices, arguing that the Tzar made the right choice. Rasputin only looked the Tzar in the eyes, and said "Before we repent, we have to sin.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC32541;Despite attempts to convince the Tzar, Rasputin stayed in court. Iliodor, one of the main orthodox priests, had Khionia Guseva attack Rasputin. She stabbed Rasputin in the stomach, just above the navel. Covered with blood, Rasputin was brought into his house. The Tzar sent his own physician and after a laparotomy and more than six weeks in the hospital, Rasputin recovered. From the hospital Rasputin sent quite a few telegrams to the court, expressing his fears for the future of the country: "If Russia goes to war, it will be the end of the monarchy, of the Romanovs and of Russian institutions." In $YEAR$, Tzar Nicholas took supreme command of the Russian armies, leaving his wife in charge of ruling the country. Alexandra loathed the Duma because of its discussion of Rasputin. While seldom meeting with Alexandra personally, Rasputin had become her personal adviser through daily telephone calls or weekly meetings with Vyrubova.

EVTDESC32543;Two city policemen on duty near the Yusupov palace heard shots and screams. They discussed the issue on the Pochtamtsky Bridge. One of them rang at the door and questioned Yusupov's butler, but was sent away. Twenty minutes later he was re-invited to the palace. Purishkevich boasted he had shot Rasputin, and asked the policeman, aware of his mistake, to keep it quiet for the sake of the Tsar. Rasputin's beaver-fur coat and the body were discovered in a frozen river, 140 meters away from the Bolshoy Petrovsky bridge, with a shot in his frontal lobe. The two nobles who killed Rasputin were exiled by the Tzar, who came back from the front. Progressively, more and more people came to the conclusion that the problem was not Rasputin but the weak-willed Emperor, who had secluded himself in Tsarskoye Selo, unable to react on what happened. The struggle between the Tsar and the Duma became more bitter than ever, and the Tsar, more secluded in his palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC32544;Everyone who met Rasputin remarked on his eyes and how hypnotic they were. His "shining steel-like" or "bright and brilliant" and "intelligent" eyes became legendary. According to Theofan, Paul Kurlov and Count Kokotsov he had "piercing" eyes. To Tamara Karsavina he had the eyes of a maniac. But his hypnotic eyes couldn't do anything against the bullet of one of the members of the Communist Party who believed he could destabilize the government by killing a close friend of the Tzar's family and the Tzarina most trusted advisor. The Russian nobility rejoiced at the death of Rasputin, assassinated as he left his home, but the death had the inverse effect that his assassin expected: the Russian Tzar left his isolation and ordered a hunt. The police organized a crackdown in every syndicate or communist party/organization, severely crippling communist support and organization, and rounding up a few suspects including a prominent figure in the communist circles, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32545;Attempt on Rapustin's Life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC32545;During a visit to his home village, while exiting a church, Rasputin was attacked by a man. The man stabbed him in the belly three times before Rasputin managed to escape, running down the street with his hands on his belly. The man chased him, but Rasputin grabbed a stick from the ground and hit him on the head. Covered with blood, Rasputin was brought into the church. After ten hours a doctor arrived from the neighboring village and operated on him in the middle of the night. Rasputin stayed days under heavy guard and the man who attacked him was never found, but he recovered. He started drinking, his paranoia increased and eventually he asked to leave the service of the Tzar, which he did despite the Royal family protesting, and lived the rest of his life as an hermit. Nobles still went looking for him, asking for advice, and after he left his public image was somewhat redeemed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
